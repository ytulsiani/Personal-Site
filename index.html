							<h2><h2>A CLIFFSNOTES ON MY LIFE</h2></h2>
							<p>
                            
                            
                                <strong>Me 1.0: </strong>I am a 21 year old student attending Georgia Institute of Technology (go Jackets) where I major in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Internetworks and Media. I was raised in the Chicagoland suburb of Schaumburg and spent my childhood eating <a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbellassai/reasons-why-deep-dish-pizza-is-better-than-all-other-pizz?utm_term=.frpNG5EWy#.jcd5QeoKl">real American pizza</a>. I have a few hobbies which include: reading things with words (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Goldfinch-Novel-Pulitzer-Prize-Fiction/dp/0316055425">my favorite book</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/">this website</a>), listening to podcasts (<a target="_blank" href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com">my favorite</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first">my other favorite</a>), geeking over new technology, petting random dogs, and all types of visual art (photography, videography, design) (<a target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/ytulsi/">Instagram</a>).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Me 2.0 (beta): </strong>I can go on forever about how I want to leave my mark on the world, but for now I'd like to tell you about one thing that's important to me. Design and visual art have always been a strong passion of mine (along with math and science) and improving what I create is something that I will never stop doing. To anyone who knows me, it comes as no surprise that I want to own a design studio and do all types of visual art and branding for companies when I graduate. It may seem counterintuitive that I study computer science and yet one day want to do design, but it's not. To me, computer science is a hybrid form of art that uses both my left and my right brain. I use logic to figure out a solution to a problem and I use creativity in choosing the most understandable way to implement the solution. If you want to meet up for some coffee and talk about why good design is a skill every computer science major should know (or even the likelihood that aliens exist), I'm always down!

                            <p>tl;dr: My past experience includes running a tutoring company, doing cloud engineering work for Ultimate Software, and website development for Home Depot. I am currently looking for a fullstack development internship for Summer 2018 and Fall 2018.</p>

									<p>
                                        Developed a Game Boy game in C where Buzz must cross a busy street while avoiding Dawgs (sorry not sorry but THWg). <br> Interesting fact: the Game Boy does not have a native timer. My game needed one, so I counted the average number of frames the Game Boy makes in a second to hack a timer.
